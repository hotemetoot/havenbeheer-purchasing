# Decisions — currently effective

Design, implementation, and workaround decisions that still apply to the current build. Superseded entries live in [decisions-archive.md](decisions-archive.md).

Scope: this is not just design. Implementation choices ("we used a workflow because formulas can't aggregate", "we deferred X to MVP9d", "pattern Y was rejected because of NocoBase limitation Z") belong here. The "why" matters more than the "what" — future-you reads these to understand constraints, not to discover features.

When adding new entries, list affected downstream MVPs by number so step 3 of the session workflow catches forward references.

## D1 — Procurement cannot cancel stalled PRs
Only the original submitter can cancel a PR. Simpler Guard C. **Affects:** MVP2.

## D2 — Procurement-originated PRs always go to director
No threshold check on this path. **Affects:** MVP6 (moot under D25 — kept for historical context).

## D5 — Projects + project-budget bypass removed from v1
No `projects` collection, no `charge_to` field, no Guards B/D, no project-budget routing. Every PR follows the same flow. Deferred to v2. **Affects:** all MVPs.

## D6 — Supplier `current_rating` is manually maintained
Procurement edits on the supplier record. No computation. **Affects:** MVP7.

## D7 — Supplier scoring scale is 1–5 (5 best)
On `supplier_evaluations.score`. **Affects:** MVP7.

## D8 — No supplier onboarding workflow
Procurement creates suppliers directly; immediately usable. ACL gate (Guard #9) is sufficient. **Affects:** MVP7.

## D9 — One PR → exactly one PO
Simpler than original "1 PR → many POs". `closed_for_new_pos` field on PR is moot under this model and is not built. **Affects:** MVP9a–e.

## D10 — PO generation is manual ("Generate PO" button)
Procurement clicks on the approved PR. No auto-creation. PO opens in `draft` pre-filled from the PR. **Affects:** MVP9a.

## D11 — Keep `po_lines`
Procurement may split the PR description into structured lines (UoM, qty, unit price) on the PO. **Affects:** MVP9a, 9c.

## D12 — PO budget-overrun zones
Keep 110% tolerance + zone 1/2/3 logic. Procurement may adjust line prices between PR and PO; overrun guard fires at `draft → sent`. Director + Finance head notified for zone 2; zone 3 blocked. **Affects:** MVP9b.

## D13 — Per-line `received_quantity`
Receiving model uses `po_lines.received_quantity` (fractional supported). **Affects:** MVP9c.

## D14 — Currencies at launch
USD, SRD, EUR. **Affects:** MVP3.

## D15 — `quotation_attachment` is multi-file
Future-proofs for multi-quote later. **Affects:** MVP3.

## D16 — Edit permission for approvers
Dept head can edit PR content while in their queue. Procurement and Director are read-only on PR content (procurement only fills its own quote fields). **Affects:** MVP1, ongoing ACL.

## D17 — Supplier `payment_terms` shape
Single-select from fixed list: Net30 / Net60 / Net90 / COD / Prepayment. **Affects:** MVP7.

## D18 — `resubmitted_from` field dropped
Rejected PRs do not formally link to a successor. Submitter creates a fresh PR.

## D19 — Notifications: in-app only
NocoBase native (workflow tasks + notification icon). No email/SMTP in v1. **Affects:** MVP9b.

## D20 — Director self-PRs deferred to v2
In v1 an assistant submits on Dana's behalf.

## D21 — Dept routing via `main_approver` + `secondary_approver`
Explicit `main_approver` (m2o → users) and `secondary_approver` (m2o → users) on `departments`. `users.on_leave` (boolean) controls fallback. Names are role-neutral ("approver", not "manager"). Replaced the unreliable `department.owners[]` array approach. **Affects:** MVP1 routing, all downstream.

**Why:** `department.owners[]` could be empty, multi-valued, or accidentally broken; the array shape made workflow filters fragile.

**How to apply:** Use `main_approver` for routing; check `on_leave` and fall back to `secondary_approver` if needed. Never reference `department.owners` in workflows.

## D22 — Manual FX rate entry on PR
User enters `fx_rate_to_usd` manually on the PR. `quoted_total_usd` is a formula field (`{{quoted_total}} * {{fx_rate_to_usd}}`, formula.js, read-only). No `fx_rates` collection. **Supersedes** the original design's FX-lookup workflow + `fx_rates` collection. **Affects:** MVP3, MVP4 (Guard E validates `fx_rate_to_usd IS NOT NULL` instead of doing a rate lookup).

**Why:** The original design had `fx_rates` collection + workflow nodes to look up rates at submit time. Built then deleted on 2026-05-24 — the lookup added complexity for no clear payoff. Manual entry gives procurement the rate they want without a separate maintenance burden.

**How to apply:** `fx_rate_to_usd` is just a number field. Guard E checks it is not null. `quoted_total_usd` requires no workflow writes.

## D23 — Manual `needs_director_approval` checkbox (instead of automatic threshold)
Submitter checks `needs_director_approval` on the PR form. Workflow conditions on the field. **Supersedes** D4 (USD director threshold $1,500) — the `approval_limits` collection was never built. Linkage rule on create form makes `justification` required when the checkbox is checked. **Affects:** MVP4.

**Why:** Routing rules weren't clear enough to automate ("is this above $1,500?" missed nuance like emergency procurement, capex vs opex). Manual checkbox shifts judgement to the submitter, which is where it belonged anyway.

**How to apply:** Workflow Procurement Approve branch conditions on this field — true → director path, false → approved immediately.

## D24 — Guard A bulk-update limitation (deferred)
Guard A does NOT intercept bulk update. Bulk-update requests send target IDs in `$context.params.filter.$and[0].id.$in`, not `$context.params.filterByTk`. Guard A's Query node looks up by `filterByTk` only, so bulk-update requests pass through. Fix requires a Script/JSON-query node to extract IDs from `$context.params.filter`, or a dedicated bulk-update workflow. **Deferred post-MVP5.** **Affects:** future hardening.

**Why:** Caught at MVP5 verification; not blocking single-record protection which is the main risk surface.

**How to apply:** If hardening bulk-update is requested, build either a Script node that reads from `$context.params.filter.$and[0].id.$in` or a separate request-interception workflow targeting `action=update` with the bulk shape.

## D26 — MVP7 descoped to suppliers only
`supplier_issues` and `supplier_evaluations` were postponed during MVP7. Only the `suppliers` collection + the optional `supplier` m2o field on `purchase_requests` were built. **Affects:** MVP7 scope; original MVP7 scenarios S3 and S4 are not applicable.

**Why:** Not blocking the PR/PO flow. Procurement can manually edit `suppliers.current_rating` and `suppliers.notes` as a placeholder (per D6). Bring issue logging + evaluations back when there's real demand.

**How to apply:** Treat `supplier_issues` and `supplier_evaluations` as not-built. Do not assume them as dependencies for MVP8 or MVP9*. Revival sketch lives in [chunks/deferred-supplier-issues-evaluations.md](chunks/deferred-supplier-issues-evaluations.md).

## D25 — Procurement staff are excluded from initiating PRs
Policy/ACL, not workflow logic. The "submitter's dept = Procurement → skip to director" routing variant is moot. The dept-owner skip (submitter IS dept approver → skip dept) was already implemented in MVP1 (condition `5hed96jh1u7`). **Supersedes** the original MVP6 scope. **Affects:** MVP6 (complete with no new build).

**Why:** Cleaner separation of duties — procurement reviews PRs, doesn't author them.

**How to apply:** ACL: `member` role used for submitting PRs; procurement-only roles do not get create-PR. No workflow change.

---

## D27 — po_lines pricing descoped
Line items track quantity + receiving only. `unit_price`, `line_total`, and `line_total_usd` are removed from `po_lines`. PO `total` is manually entered from the supplier invoice (no derivation from lines). **Affects:** MVP9a (this revision — Generate-PO workflow no longer writes `unit_price` on the default line; planned 9a.4 Total-maintenance workflow is cancelled); MVP9c (receiving) — only `received_quantity` and `line_status` change; no $-math on lines. MVP9d, MVP9e unaffected.

**Why:** Formula fields can only reference same-collection scalars (see `feedback_formula_field_scope`), so `line_total_usd` cannot traverse to `purchase_order.fx_rate_to_usd`. The denormalize-fx alternative would add a sync-workflow per PO update for a value not currently needed at line level. Pricing decisions in this domain happen at the PO header (supplier invoice = source of truth for $$), and line items are quantity-tracking artifacts. Simpler model overall.

**How to apply:** Don't restore the deleted fields. If a future MVP needs line-level USD reporting, denormalize `fx_rate_to_usd` onto `po_lines` and recompute line USD via a workflow update — don't try to formula-traverse the relation.

---

## D28 — Cancel collapsed into Close (two terminal PO states)
The PO `cancelled` status is removed. Cancelling a PO is now just closing it with an appropriate `close_reason` (e.g. `no_longer_required`). Two terminal states only: `completed` (happy path) and `closed` (everything else, always with a `close_reason` + `close_comment`). The former `draft → cancelled` action becomes `draft → closed`. **Affects:** MVP9b (built this way — Close PO workflow `close_po_draft` stamps `status=closed`, `closed_at`); MVP9a collection definition (`cancelled` dropped from `purchase_orders.status` enum; `no_longer_required` added to `close_reason`); MVP9d (close-from-non-draft builds on this single close path). **Supersedes** PO design-validation §3 (status state machine) and §8 guard #8 wherever they distinguish cancel from close.

**Why:** A separate `cancelled` state added a parallel terminal path and its own audit field (`cancelled_at`) without behavioural difference from a reason-tagged close. Collapsing them simplifies the state machine, the guards, and the UI (one Close button + reason picker instead of Cancel and Close).

**How to apply:** Treat `closed` as the only non-happy terminal state. Use `close_reason = no_longer_required` for what was previously "cancel". The `cancelled_at` field still physically exists on `purchase_orders` (drop was blocked by the irreversible-action guard) but is unused — no workflow writes it; safe to drop later with explicit user OK. Don't reintroduce a `cancelled` status.

---

## D29 — Optional submitter-chosen skip of dept-head approval
Submitters may opt to skip the department-head approval stage per PR via a
`skip_dept_approval` boolean (default false). When skipped, the dept head is **not** a
blocking approver but is **kept in the loop**: an in-app FYI notification to the submitter's
`mainDepartment.main_approver` (fallback `secondary_approver` when on leave, per D21) plus
view access to the PR. The pre-existing "submitter IS their own dept approver → auto-skip"
path (condition `5hed96jh1u7`) is unchanged and does **not** notify. **Affects:** MVP1
(approval workflow `cv237r8h7k9` — new condition branch + notify node, revisioned), MVP4
(toggle sits beside `needs_director_approval` on the create form). Built as MVP010.

**Why:** The team confirmed dept-head approval isn't always required, but the exact rule is
unclear and likely to stay fuzzy. Rather than encode a brittle rule, we add flexibility and
shift the judgment to the submitter — the same reasoning as D23 (manual
`needs_director_approval` over an automatic threshold). FYI-only (no pull-back) keeps it in
line with D19 (in-app only) and avoids re-injecting an approval mid-flight, which NocoBase
approval workflows don't support cleanly.

**How to apply:** Workflow branches: if submitter is NOT their own dept approver, test
`skip_dept_approval` — true → notify dept head + route to `pending_purchasing_review`;
false → existing Dept Owner Approval. No new status. Ensure the dept head can *open* a
skipped PR (verify the dept-owner view scope; widen only if it's task-driven). The skip is
not a pull-back mechanism — the dept head is informed, not gating.

## D30 — Mandatory director approval at ≥ $300 USD (floor on top of the manual checkbox)
Any PR whose `quoted_total_usd` is **≥ 300** must always route to the Director, regardless of
the submitter's `needs_director_approval` checkbox. This is a **floor added on top of** D23, not
a replacement: the checkbox still works as a *voluntary escalation* (a submitter can send a sub-
$300 PR to the Director), and the threshold forces the Director path even when the box is off.
The two combine as **OR** in the existing director-decision condition `bizoy1sj87j` (PR Approval
workflow `cv237r8h7k9`): `needs_director_approval == true` **OR** `quoted_total_usd >= 300`.
Boundary is **inclusive** (exactly $300.00 requires director). Threshold is **hardcoded** as
`300` (no config collection). **Partially supersedes** D23 for the director-decision node — D23's
"director routing is purely the submitter's checkbox" no longer holds; the checkbox is now the
*lower* bound of when the Director is involved. **Affects:** MVP4 (the director-decision
condition); implemented as a workflow revision (`367150157135872` → `367158084370432`), built +
verified 2026-05-30.

**Why:** The team wanted a hard guarantee that larger spends always reach the Director, while
keeping the manual-judgment flexibility of D23 for everything below the line. A floor (rather
than reverting to a pure threshold like the old $1,500 rule) preserves both: judgment below
$300, certainty at/above it.

**How to apply:** The threshold is evaluated on `quoted_total_usd` (the stored USD formula
field), read in the condition via `{{$jobsMapByNodeKey.ec2h8cqal32.data.quoted_total_usd}}`.
It computes to `0` when no quote is entered, so a missing quote never trips the floor. Basic
condition engine, `gte` calculator — no arithmetic/calculation node needed (the
`feedback_prefer_mathjs_engine` caveat is about `$jobsMapByNodeKey` *result* references, not
field-scalar comparisons). To change the threshold or boundary later, revision the workflow and
edit the single `gte` leaf on `bizoy1sj87j`.

## D31 — PR number is the source; PO number is derived by prefix swap
Every `purchase_requests` record now carries `pr_number`, an auto-`sequence` field
`PR-YY-NNNN` (2-digit year, 4-digit yearly-cycling counter, e.g. `PR-26-0004`). It is
assigned automatically at **PR creation** (`inputable: false`), so abandoned/cancelled
drafts leave gaps in the numbering — accepted. The matching purchase order takes the
**exact same number with the prefix swapped** (`PR-26-0004` → `PO-26-0004`) so the two
documents are visibly paired.

**Why two independent sequences were rejected:** PR and PO counters increment separately
and not every PR becomes a PO, so parallel sequences would drift and never match. The PR
**owns** the number; the PO **derives** it. Cross-relation formula fields can't read
`purchase_request.pr_number` from the PO side (see `feedback_formula_field_scope`), so the
derivation is done inside the Generate-PO workflow, which means `po_number` had to stop
being an auto-sequence.

**How it's built:**
- The old `po_number` **sequence** field on `purchase_orders` was deleted by the user and
  replaced with a plain `string`/`input` field that the workflow writes.
- Generate-PO workflow (`2izsx8uv50r`) revisioned to active version `367255610327040`: a
  new formula.js calculation node `umk9xiw5aio` computes
  `SUBSTITUTE({{$context.data.pr_number}}, "PR-", "PO-")`, and the Create-PO node
  (`ubg9mju1tjm`) assigns `po_number = {{$jobsMapByNodeKey.umk9xiw5aio}}`.
- Pre-existing PRs would stay `pr_number = null` (sequence only fires on new inserts), and a PO
  generated from a null-`pr_number` PR would get a blank `po_number` — but moot now: **all PR/PO/
  po_lines test data was cleared by the user on 2026-05-30** after verification, so the tables
  start empty. The sequence counter does not roll back on delete, so the first new PR will be
  `PR-26-0002` (`PR-26-0001` was consumed by the deleted verification PR).

Built + verified end-to-end 2026-05-30 (PR `PR-26-0001` → PO `PO-26-0001`). **Affects:**
MVP9a (Generate-PO), and any future receiving/reporting MVP that references PO numbering.

## D32 — Mandatory board approval at ≥ $15,000 USD (second floor, above the Director)
Any PR whose `quoted_total_usd` is **≥ 15000** must, *after* the Director approves, route to a
new **Board Approval** stage instead of going straight to `approved`. The board does not use the
app — they sign a hard copy — so the in-app step exists to **record** that decision: Procurement
(Pat, user 11) uploads the signed document and approves. This is a **floor on top of D30**
(director ≥ $300): a ≥ $15k PR already passes the director under D30, so the board branch always
hangs off the director-approve branch — there is no "board but no director" case. Boundary is
**inclusive** (exactly $15,000.00 requires board); threshold **hardcoded** as `15000`.

**Mechanism (chosen over a free-floating attachment + guarded button):** a 4th approval node
mirroring the existing three. The required signed-document attachment is enforced natively by a
**required field on the approval ProcessForm**, the task lands in Procurement's queue (won't be
forgotten), and reject/return come for free. New status value `pending_board_approval`. New field
`purchase_requests.board_approval_document` (multi-attachment). Implemented as a workflow revision
(`367158084370432` → `367885604880384`, key `cv237r8h7k9`): on the Director-approve branch a
condition `fro4hak78r9` (`gte`, reusing the proven D30 reference
`{{$jobsMapByNodeKey.ec2h8cqal32.data.quoted_total_usd}}`) routes **< $15k → approved** (existing
node `kj1zcmujub8`) and **≥ $15k → pending_board_approval → Board Approval node `01upqmcb1qy`
(assignee 11)** → approve/return/reject. Built + verified end-to-end 2026-06-02 (16,000 USD PR).
**Affects:** MVP4 (director-decision area); the PR Approval workflow lineage.

**ACL dependency (D32a):** recording board approval requires Procurement to **upload** the signed
file, which is a `create` on the `attachments` collection. Procurement's global strategy was
`view/trigger/update` (no create), so this 403'd. Granted a **narrow independent resource
permission**: procurement → `attachments` → `view/create/update` (scope all). Deliberately **not**
a global `create` (that would let procurement create PRs, violating D25). See auto-memory
`feedback_approver_attachment_upload_acl`.

**Build gotcha (not a decision, recorded for context):** the board approval form was built via
`applyApprovalBlueprint`, which omits the per-action `CommentFormModel`; approvers then 403 on
`flowModels:save` when the runtime tries to create it. Fixed by pre-creating three
`CommentFormModel`s (`bcmt_approve/reject/return`) and setting each action's `commentFormUid`. See
auto-memory `feedback_approval_blueprint_comment_models`.

**Why a floor, not a pure threshold:** same reasoning as D30 — preserves the manual-judgment
flexibility below the line while guaranteeing the largest spends always reach the board. To change
the threshold/boundary later, revision the workflow and edit the single `gte` leaf on `fro4hak78r9`.
