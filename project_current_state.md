# Current Build State

**Last verified:** 2026-06-09 (**MVP012 DONE + VERIFIED** — A1–A7 all passed via test users; user set the picker data scope (same-dept + exclude-self) in the form UI. Submitter-selectable dept-stage approver, retires the MVP010 skip (D36, supersedes D29). Two new `purchase_requests` fields: `use_custom_approver` (boolean), `custom_approver` (m2o → users, FK `customApproverId`). **PR Approval workflow `cv237r8h7k9` revisioned to active `369076269481984`** (30 nodes) — the skip branch was repurposed into a custom-approver branch: condition `eafkgfa3axi` retitled "Custom approver chosen?" = AND(`use_custom_approver==true`, `custom_approver.id != null`, `custom_approver.id != createdById` self-exclusion); br=1 → reused notify `5h232imw9ss` (FYI dept head) → new approval node `fifkfnqn9pm` "Custom Approver Approval" (assignee `{{$context.data.custom_approver.id}}`, approvalUid `1a1zhqfmpdl`/taskCardUid `369lxzap6i2`, duplicated from Dept Owner node so form+comment models identical) → outcome updates `r8f85w1w1ze`/`8loza7mypxd`/`vhize11vzsg`; br=0 → unchanged Dept Owner Approval `cfg687cye3n`. `custom_approver` added to trigger appends. Auto-skip `5hed96jh1u7` (submitter IS dept head) unchanged + still first. **Doc-lag corrected:** active PR-Approval before this was `368983543906304` (NOT `368641179582464` as previously recorded) — both now stale. **UI:** create form `e76c40c8c79` got checkbox `r9iu06my5ot` + picker `gfozpat06nw` + show/require linkage; detail popup `2b367dbd157` got both fields read-only (`7jjizc66ex2`/`9tpfw54yy1e`) and the skip read-only `in24ndj91et` was removed. **`skip_dept_approval` column RETAINED but dead** (no workflow reads/writes it; off both forms). Picker data scope (same-dept + exclude-self) was set by the user via the form "Set data scope" UI (public CLI can't author it); self-approval is also hard-blocked server-side. **Only remaining (low priority):** drop the dead `skip_dept_approval` column with explicit OK. See D36. Earlier same day: **MVP9e DONE + VERIFIED** — PO template printing: Carbone template `printingTemplates:kkooshlz8rf` → `storage/print-templates/po-template-mvp9e.docx` (Havenbeheer-branded), Print button `c579329db0d`; user confirmed live PDF on PO-26-0006, P2 internal_notes-not-printed holds. See the `printingTemplates` collection + MVP9e note in "Notes for the next session". Earlier same day: **MVP9d fully VERIFIED end-to-end** — all 8 cases C1/C2/C3/C4/C5 + D34a/D34b/D35 passed via Pat-driven UI clicks against API-staged fixtures; see "Notes for the next session". D34 — Complete PO requires an attached invoice + positive `total_usd`; guard revisioned `368746204954624`→`368971625791488`, Complete button `e60dce0bb2d` linkage extended. D35 — Close Guard request-interception `b6brl8r9c58` rejects + messages a Close attempt on a non-closeable (e.g. `received`) PO, which the post-action Close workflow couldn't.** See Complete/Close workflow sections + decisions D34/D35. Prior baseline below from 2026-06-07.) Earlier: live env queried via `nb api` — **MVP9d backend built (Complete workflow + broadened Close + PO/line immutability guards); UI buttons + end-to-end C1–C5 verification PENDING (user wires the buttons)**; MVP9c PO-receiving verified; D32/MVP011 board-approval ≥ $15k; PR/PO numbering D31; director-approval $300 floor D30; MVP9b Send-PO + Close-PO; MVP010 skip-dept-approval). Next: **MVP9d verification, then MVP9e — PO template printing (not started; a bare "Template print" button exists on the PO detail block but no template is configured or tested)**.

**MVP9d backend built 2026-06-07 (PO completion / closing / immutability) — UI + verification pending.** Scope aligned to **D28** (no `cancel` action, no `cancelled` status — "cancel a draft" is just close-with-reason, already in 9b). Four workflow changes: (1) **Complete PO** (custom-action, sync, key `qh7b3hc5q1r`, ver `368746204954624`): guard `complete_guard` (status==received) → true: `complete_update` status=completed + completed_at; false: reject msg + end(-1). (2) **Close PO** rebuilt as a **post-action event** (`action` type, sync, local mode, key `f8gpu17s6hq`, ver `368791950131200`): guard `close2_guard` (status ∈ {draft,sent,confirmed,partially_received}) → `close2_update` (status=closed, closed_at=now). **Correction:** the original 9d build wrongly made Close a `custom-action` (`close_po_draft`) — a form Submit can only bind pre/post-action/approval, so custom-action couldn't bind; the old one is disabled + renamed "(deprecated custom-action)". The user binds `f8gpu17s6hq` to the Close EditForm's Submit (local mode). (3) **Guard: PO Immutability** (request-interception, global, sync, key `xvcsdv07c5j`, ver `368747670863872`; actions update+destroy on `purchase_orders`): query target PO → condition OR status∈{completed,closed} → reject msg + end(-1). (4) **Guard: PO Line Immutability** (request-interception, global, sync, key `f3dkb37te22`, ver `368747750555648`; actions update+destroy on `po_lines`): query line (appends purchase_order) → condition OR purchase_order.status∈{completed,closed} → reject msg + end(-1). No new fields (completed_at/closed_at/close_reason/close_comment + status enum all pre-existed). **UI:** the user builds the Complete + Close buttons themselves (as with the 9c receiving UI); the doc-recorded Close button `lylrxwl1b3g` was **removed by the user** and is gone from the surface. **Caveat:** the PO immutability guard locks ALL updates on terminal POs, including payment fields — fine now (no Finance payment UI/workflow built, finance role strategy = null), but a future payment MVP will need a carve-out (cf. the `closed_for_new_pos` exemption pattern). See D33.

**Doc-lag corrected 2026-06-07 (live `nb api` re-query):** active versions had drifted from the doc — **Send PO** active is `367086330314752` (was recorded `366981771362304`); **PR Approval** active is `368641179582464` (was `367885604880384`); **PO Receiving recompute** active is `368710576439296` (was `368072534523904`). Sections below updated. A stray disabled PR-Approval ver `368062113775616` may also exist (not re-confirmed this session).

**MVP9c built + verified 2026-06-07 (PO receiving).** Receiving UI built by the user; R1–R4 passed (partial→partially_received; full→received + Pat notified; correct-down reverts received→partially_received; receiving on non-sent PO blocked). Two workflows: (1) **Guard: Receive** (request-interception, key `mhfp4d15uee`, ver `368072131870720`) blocks a `received_quantity` change on a PO not in `sent`/`confirmed`/`partially_received`/`received`; (2) **PO Receiving recompute** (collection trigger, key `ork27v016yo`, ver `368072534523904`) derives `po_lines.line_status` + PO header status on `received_quantity` change, and notifies Procurement (Pat) when fully received. Pricing untouched (D27 — no PO-total recompute). No new fields (received_quantity/line_status already existed from 9a; Record History already on via collection-level `logging:true`). No plan changes during build → no D-entry.

**D32 built + verified 2026-06-02 (MVP011):** mandatory board approval at `quoted_total_usd >= 15000`, *after* the director. New status `pending_board_approval`, new multi-attachment field `board_approval_document`. PR Approval revisioned `367158084370432` → **`367885604880384`** (key `cv237r8h7k9`); board branch hangs off the director-approve branch via condition `fro4hak78r9`, routing ≥ $15k to a 4th approval node **Board Approval** (`01upqmcb1qy`, assignee Pat) whose ProcessForm requires the signed-doc upload. Two follow-on fixes were needed to make a fresh approval form usable by a non-admin approver: (1) granted Procurement `create` on `attachments` (independent resource perm) so Pat can upload; (2) pre-created the per-action `CommentFormModel`s the blueprint omits (else approver 403 on `flowModels:save`). See decisions D32 and auto-memory `feedback_approver_attachment_upload_acl` + `feedback_approval_blueprint_comment_models`.

MVPs 1–8 built. MVP7 was reduced to suppliers-only (D26). MVP8 added comments collection + 4 soft fields + UI surfaces; the comments UI block in the PR detail popup was removed by the user post-verification (data layer remains — can be re-added). **MVP9a built 2026-05-26**: PO + po_lines + lookups, Generate-PO workflow (`2izsx8uv50r` v `366595041853440`), Create-PO Guard (`vgv8hcrtjvx`), Generate-PO button on PR surfaces with procurement-only visibility. PR↔PO relation re-shaped to clean m2o + virtual hasOne. **MVP9b built 2026-05-29**: PO `draft → sent` with budget-zone guard (Send PO workflow `send_po`), PO `draft → closed` (Close PO workflow `close_po_draft`), Send + Close buttons on PO surfaces. `cancelled` collapsed into `closed` (D28). Zone-2 in-app notifications (9b.3) deferred — gated on Finance dept `main_approver` being set (still NULL). **MVP010 built + verified 2026-05-29:** optional submitter `skip_dept_approval` (D29) — field + UI toggle live; PR Approval workflow revision `367150157135872` (key `cv237r8h7k9`) activated and end-to-end verified by user. When skipped, dept head gets an in-app FYI notification and the PR routes straight to Procurement. **D30 built + verified 2026-05-30:** mandatory director approval at **`quoted_total_usd >= 300`** — PR Approval revisioned to `367158084370432` (key `cv237r8h7k9`); the director-decision condition `bizoy1sj87j` is now an OR of the manual `needs_director_approval` checkbox and the $300 USD floor. Next: **MVP9c — receiving**.

### `purchase_requests`

| Field | Interface | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| pr_number | sequence | **D31** — auto `PR-YY-NNNN` (2-digit year, 4-digit yearly-cycling counter, e.g. `PR-26-0004`); field key `jo6vvssc0i5`, `inputable: false`. Assigned at PR creation. PO derives its number from this (see Generate-PO workflow). **Counter note:** `PR-26-0001` was consumed by a since-deleted verification PR; deleting records does not roll back a sequence counter, so the next new PR will be **`PR-26-0002`**. |

### Collections NOT built (postponed — D26)
- `supplier_issues` — postponed from MVP7
- `supplier_evaluations` — postponed from MVP7

### `pr_comments` (MVP8 — built 2026-05-26)

Comment-template collection (`@nocobase/plugin-comments`). Baseline fields only: `id`, `content` (vditor, long text, not deletable), `createdAt`, `createdBy`, `updatedAt`, `updatedBy`. Linked to `purchase_requests` via the `purchase_requests.comments` o2m relation.

### `purchase_orders` (MVP9a — built 2026-05-26)

Header collection for purchase orders. Created via Generate-PO workflow from approved PRs (one PR → one PO per D9).

Key fields: `po_number` (**D31** — plain `string`/`input` field, key `esjop6vlpp9`; the old auto-`sequence` field was deleted by the user and replaced. Written by the Generate-PO workflow as the PR's `pr_number` with the `PR-` prefix swapped to `PO-`, e.g. `PO-26-0004`), `purchase_request` (m2o → purchase_requests, FK `purchaseRequestId`), `supplier` (m2o), `delivery_address` (m2o), `status` (default `draft`), `currency`, `fx_rate_to_usd`, `total` (workflow-maintained, no formula), `total_usd` (formula.js: `{{total}} / {{fx_rate_to_usd}}` — division, local-per-USD), `payment_status`, `payment_date`, `expected_delivery_date`, `invoice` (attachment), `attachments` (attachment multi), `supplier_note`, `internal_notes`, `budget_override_comment`, `close_reason`, `close_comment`, audit timestamps (`sent_at`, `confirmed_at`, `completed_at`, `closed_at`).

**`status` values (post-9b):** `draft`, `sent`, `confirmed`, `partially_received`, `received`, `completed`, `closed`. `cancelled` was removed in MVP9b (D28 — collapsed into `closed`). Two terminal states: `completed` (happy path) and `closed` (everything else, with a `close_reason`).
**`close_reason` values:** `no_longer_required`, `supplier_unable_to_fulfill`, `partial_fulfillment_accepted`, `duplicate`, `replaced_by_new_po`, `other`.
**Note:** the `cancelled_at` datetime field still physically exists (the drop was blocked by the irreversible-action guard in MVP9b) — it is unused and no workflow writes it. Safe to drop later with explicit user OK.

### `po_lines` (MVP9a — built 2026-05-26)

Line items for purchase orders — **pricing was descoped 2026-05-26 (D27)**. Lines now track quantity + receiving only; financial values stay at PO level (manually entered from supplier invoice). Fields: `purchase_order` (m2o), `product` (m2o optional), `description` (textarea, required), `unit_of_measure` (m2o), `quantity_ordered`, `received_quantity`, `line_status` (default `pending`). Previously had `unit_price`, `line_total` (formula), `line_total_usd` (formula); all three deleted. The planned 9a.4 Total-maintenance workflow is **cancelled** — PO `total` is no longer derived from lines.

### `delivery_addresses`, `units_of_measure`, `products` (MVP9a — built 2026-05-26)

Lookup collections. `delivery_addresses` has `name` (title), `address`, `is_default`, `status`. `units_of_measure` has `name` (title, **unique**), `abbreviation`, `status`. `products` (v1 stub) has `name` (title, **unique**), `description`, `default_uom` (m2o → units_of_measure), `status`.

### `printingTemplates` (MVP9e — template-print registry)

Owned by `@nocobase/plugin-action-template-print`. One record per print template. Fields: `name` (the `templateName` the Print button references), `title`, `collectionName`, `rootDataType`, `dataSource`, `filename`.

| Record `name` | title | collectionName | filename | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `kkooshlz8rf` | Purchase Order | purchase_orders | `po-template-mvp9e.docx` | MVP9e PO template (Carbone). Bound to Print button `c579329db0d`. Old stub `17809643261187811286095403871.docx` kept on disk for rollback. |

The `.docx` files live on disk at **`/Users/alexander/nocobase/storage/print-templates/`** (not in attachments). Repo source-of-truth: `templates/build_po_template.py` → `templates/purchase-order-template.docx` (+ `templates/main-logo.png`). To change: edit builder → run it → `cp` docx over the storage file (file overwrite, no live config write). Carbone markers: data root `d`; **select fields use `.label`**; assoc to po_lines is **`lines`**; **`internal_notes` is NOT rendered** (P2). See auto-memory `feedback_template_print_*`.

  - Director (`sxvxwl498xg`): approvalUid `cgctmkrd7c5`, taskCardUid `wlibpupq7mx`
  - **Board (`01upqmcb1qy`, D32 — built via `applyApprovalBlueprint`, NOT cloned):** approvalUid `4eydmvrzsxs`, taskCardUid `gurwtm8po6b`. ProcessForm `he7olrujn6w` with **editable+required** `board_approval_document` (wrapper `y07ibxtl4i9`, `editItemSettings.required.required=true`) + a read-only `approvalInformation` block (`x3c2i31k26v`, 7 PR fields). Actions: Approve `0nxvt0eutij` / Reject `urne0a35pt9` / Return `ai7gyigfny1`.
- **Board comment models (D32):** the blueprint did NOT create the per-action `CommentFormModel`, causing approver `flowModels:save` 403 ("Failed to load or create comment model"). Pre-created `bcmt_approve` / `bcmt_reject` / `bcmt_return` (standalone `CommentFormModel` flowModels) and set each board action's `commentFormUid` to match a working node. See auto-memory `feedback_approval_blueprint_comment_models`.

The four MVP8 fields (`expenditure_type`, `is_emergency`, `needed_by`, `other_attachments`) are present on all three approval forms: editable on dept, read-only (`pattern: readPretty`) on procurement and director.

### Cancel Purchase Request workflow
- **Key:** `59ezifdoqvj`
- **Active version ID:** `364980262862848` (enabled=true)
- **Type:** custom-action, sync=true, collection=purchase_requests, appends=["submitter"]
- **Guard C (embedded):** condition node `kj9d7bnvw02` — AND: user.id==submitter.id AND status=="draft", rejectOnFalse=false
- **Update node:** `5pl72u5ktdm` (branch=1) — sets status=cancelled, cancelled_at={{$system.now}}, cancellation_reason from form

### Cancel PR Guard (request-interception)
- **Key:** `8yngslauuj4`
- **Active version ID:** `364984924831744` (enabled=true)
- **Type:** request-interception — server-side guard on cancel attempts

### Guard A — PR immutability (MVP5)
- **Key:** `496ookqmg01`
- **Active version ID:** `366217145548800` (enabled=true)
- **Type:** request-interception, global, sync; actions: update + destroy on `purchase_requests`
- **Node chain:** Query (`q33wtlxitr1`) → Condition OR status∈{approved,rejected,cancelled} (`nbs3zmsr60x`) → branch 1: response-message + end(endStatus:-1)
- **Known limitation (D24):** does NOT intercept bulk update. See [decisions.md](decisions.md).

### Generate PO workflow (MVP9a; D31 PO-number derivation)
- **Key:** `2izsx8uv50r`
- **Active version ID:** `367255610327040` (enabled=true, current=true) — **D31 revision: derive `po_number` from PR's `pr_number`, built + verified 2026-05-30.** Revision of `366626572533760` (which itself was a user revision after the doc previously recorded `366623590383616` as active — that and the other intermediate versions are now stale; see Stale IDs).
- **Type:** custom-action, sync, collection `purchase_requests`; appends `[supplier, purchase_order]`.
- **Node chain (7 nodes):** Guard condition (`uufqoeb8xyz`, AND of `status==approved` + `purchase_order==null`):
  - branch 1 (true) → Query default delivery address (`ay8dlnys4ef`) → **Calculation `umk9xiw5aio` (D31, formula.js): `SUBSTITUTE({{$context.data.pr_number}}, "PR-", "PO-")`** → Create purchase_orders (`ubg9mju1tjm`, sets `po_number={{$jobsMapByNodeKey.umk9xiw5aio}}`, `createdById={{$context.user.id}}`) → Create po_lines default line (`4p3q7oq3co5`, writes only `purchase_order`/`description`/`quantity_ordered=1`)
  - branch 0 (false) → Response message (`ylrivonemrq`) → End process (`gviz4zia0ha`, endStatus: -1)
- The `response-message` + `end-process(-1)` pair on the false branch (per [`feedback_inline_guard_end_node`](../../../.claude/projects/-Users-alexander-Documents-Claude-Projects-Havenbeheer-Purchasing/memory/feedback_inline_guard_end_node.md)) is preserved across the D31 revision.
- **Bound to button:** `28jh1q2camo` (Generate PO button, visible on PR table block `l1e2iwdwau9` and PR detail popup `2b367dbd157`). Binding is by key, unaffected by the revision.

### Create-PO Guard (MVP9a)
- **Key:** `vgv8hcrtjvx`
- **Active version ID:** `366562380808192` (enabled=true)
- **Type:** request-interception, global, sync; actions: `create` on `purchase_orders`
- **Node chain:** Query referenced PR (`ww4mxz67ge8`, appends `purchase_order`) → Condition OR pr.status≠approved | pr.purchase_order≠null (`dba34lyg168`) → branch 1: response-message (`7fp12f2018u`) + end (`j57v75y2cky`, endStatus:-1).

### Send PO workflow (MVP9b) — `draft → sent` + budget zones
- **Key:** `send_po`
- **Active version ID:** `367086330314752` (enabled=true, current=true) — **doc-lag corrected 2026-06-07** (was recorded `366981771362304`, which is now a disabled prior version). Node keys/structure unchanged from the description below; the math.js zone-2 fix is carried.
- **Type:** custom-action, sync, collection `purchase_orders`; appends `[purchase_request, supplier]` (supplier appended now for future supplier-email step).
- **15-node chain** (node keys, branch structure):
  - `g_send_guard` (condition, basic) — AND status==draft, total≠null, fx_rate_to_usd≠null.
    - br=0 (false) → `g_send_fail_msg` (response-message) → `g_send_fail_end` (end, -1).
    - br=1 (true) → `calc_po_usd`.
  - `calc_po_usd` (calculation, **math.js**): `{{$context.data.total}} / {{$context.data.fx_rate_to_usd}}` → `c2dibomnrby`.
  - `c2dibomnrby` (calculation, formula.js): `{{$context.data.purchase_request.quoted_total}}/{{$context.data.purchase_request.fx_rate_to_usd}}` (PR total in USD) → `calc_cap_usd`.
  - `calc_cap_usd` (calculation, **math.js**): `{{$jobsMapByNodeKey.c2dibomnrby}} * 1.1` (110% cap) → `z3_check`.
  - `z3_check` (condition, basic `gt`): `calc_po_usd.result > calc_cap_usd.result`.
    - br=1 (true, zone 3) → `z3_msg` (response-message) → `z3_end` (end, -1).
    - br=0 (false) → `z2_check`.
  - `z2_check` (condition, **math.js**): `{{$jobsMapByNodeKey.calc_po_usd}}>{{$jobsMapByNodeKey.c2dibomnrby}}` (zone 2 = PO USD over PR USD).
    - br=1 (true, zone 2) → `oc_check`.
    - br=0 (false, zone 1) → `z1_update` (update status=sent, sent_at=now).
  - `oc_check` (condition, basic) — OR budget_override_comment==null | =="".
    - br=1 (true, comment missing) → `oc_msg` (response-message) → `oc_end` (end, -1).
    - br=0 (false, comment present) → `z2_update` (update status=sent, sent_at=now).
- **Bound to button:** `slybgc23q1i` (Send PO, `RecordTriggerWorkflowActionModel`) on PO surfaces.
- **Engine note:** `z2_check` originally used the basic `gt` calculator and never fired (every PO fell to zone 1); switching the node to math.js fixed it. See auto-memory `feedback_prefer_mathjs_engine`. **Zone 2 verified 2026-05-29** (exec `366982002049024`: PO 2.8 USD vs PR 2.667 USD, cap 2.933 → zone 2, missing comment → rejected). Zone-2 in-app notifications (9b.3) are **not yet built** — gated on Finance `main_approver`.

### Close PO workflow (MVP9d, **post-action event**) — `draft/sent/confirmed/partially_received → closed`
- **Key:** `f8gpu17s6hq` · title "Close PO"
- **Active version ID:** `368791950131200` (enabled=true, current=true) — built 2026-06-07.
- **Type:** **`action` (Post-action event), sync, local mode** (`global:false`), collection `purchase_orders`. Bound by the user to the Close popup EditForm's **Submit** under **Bind workflows → post-action event (local mode)**. (A form Submit can ONLY bind pre-action/post-action/approval — **not** custom-action; the old custom-action close was the wrong type. See auto-memory `feedback_workflow_form_button_pattern` — corrected.)
- **Nodes (2):** `close2_guard` (condition, basic, OR of `equal {{$context.data.status}}` against `draft`/`sent`/`confirmed`/`partially_received`, rejectOnFalse=false) → br=1 (true): `close2_update` (update `purchase_orders` where id=`{{$context.data.id}}`, status=closed, closed_at=now). No false-branch nodes — **a post-action event runs AFTER the update and cannot reject or surface a message** (confirmed via the trigger reference: `type:"action"` = Post-action Event). So this workflow just skips stamping when not closeable; the user-facing rejection is now done by the **Close Guard** request-interception workflow below (D35).
- Flow: the EditForm Submit saves `close_reason` + `close_comment` (its own update), then this post-action workflow stamps `status=closed`, `closed_at`. **Note:** `received` is intentionally NOT closeable (a received PO completes; to bail, correct a line down to revert to `partially_received` first — D33).
- **Deprecated predecessor:** `close_po_draft` (`366780629319680`, custom-action) — wrong trigger type (custom-action can't bind to a form Submit), **disabled + renamed "Close PO (deprecated custom-action)"** 2026-06-07. Kept for rollback; safe to delete with explicit user OK. The MVP9b "close from draft via form" was never actually bindable.

### Close Guard (D35, 2026-06-09) — reject + message when closing a non-closeable PO
- **Key:** `b6brl8r9c58` · title "Close Guard — block close on non-closeable PO"
- **Active version ID:** `368982201729024` (enabled=true, current=true).
- **Why:** the Close PO workflow is a **post-action** event and can't show a failure message; a Close attempt on a `received` PO previously saved `close_reason`/`close_comment` and silently did nothing (no message). The PO immutability guard `xvcsdv07c5j` only covers `completed`/`closed`, leaving `received` as a silent gap. This guard fills it.
- **Type:** request-interception (Pre-action Event), global, sync; actions: `update` on `purchase_orders`.
- **Nodes (4):** `close_guard_query` (query purchase_orders, multiple=false, filter id=`{{$context.params.filterByTk}}`, failOnEmpty=false) → `close_guard_cond` (condition, basic, **AND**, rejectOnFalse=false) of: `notEqual {{$context.params.values.close_reason}} != null` (a close attempt — same `values.<field>` pattern as the Receive guard, so it does NOT fire on a normal edit that omits `close_reason`) **AND** `{{$jobsMapByNodeKey.close_guard_query.status}}` ≠ each of `draft`/`sent`/`confirmed`/`partially_received` (i.e. status NOT in the closeable set) → br=1 (true=block): `close_guard_msg` (response-message) → `close_guard_end` (end, -1).
- **Logic verified** via `flow-nodes test`: close attempt on `received`/`completed` → block; close attempt on `sent`/`draft` → allowed; normal edit (no `close_reason`) on `received` → allowed (no false-block). **D24 bulk-update limitation applies** (relies on `filterByTk`). For `completed`/`closed` this guard and `xvcsdv07c5j` both fire (redundant, harmless).
- **Caveat:** detection keys on `close_reason` being present in the submitted values. If a future PO **edit** form includes a non-empty `close_reason` field on a `received` PO, it would be blocked — keep `close_reason`/`close_comment` out of the normal edit form (they belong to the Close popup only).

### Complete PO workflow (MVP9d; D34 invoice gate) — `received → completed`
- **Key:** `qh7b3hc5q1r`
- **Active version ID:** `368971625791488` (enabled=true, current=true) — **D34 revision built 2026-06-09: Complete now also requires an attached invoice AND a positive invoice total (USD).** Revision of `368746204954624` (now disabled — see Stale IDs). The predecessor's recorded `executed:0` was stale; `versionStats.executed` was 3 (user's C1 runs completed PO-26-0002/0005), so the change required a same-key revision, not an in-place edit.
- **Type:** custom-action, sync, collection `purchase_orders`. **Trigger appends:** `["invoice"]` (D34 — so the guard can see the attachment; `invoice` is a `belongsToMany` to `attachments`, loads as `[]` when empty).
- **Nodes (8):**
  - `complete_guard` (root; condition, **basic**, AND of `equal {{$context.data.status}} == "received"` **and** `gt {{$context.data.total_usd}} > 0`, rejectOnFalse=false). Basic engine chosen for these two because it returns `false` (not an error) when `total_usd` is null — math.js throws on `null > 0`.
    - br=0 (false) → `complete_fail_msg` (response-message, "Complete is only available for a fully-received PO with an invoice total (USD).") → `complete_fail_end` (end, -1).
    - br=1 (true) → `inv_count`.
  - `inv_count` (calculation, **math.js**): `count({{$context.data.invoice}})` → number of attached invoice files (`[]`→0).
  - `complete_invoice_guard` (condition, **math.js**, `{{$jobsMapByNodeKey.inv_count}} >= 1`, rejectOnFalse=false). math.js used because the basic engine has **no array-emptiness calculator** (`empty`/`notEmpty` are unregistered) and math.js resolves `{{$jobsMapByNodeKey.<key>}}` without `.result`.
    - br=0 (false) → `complete_inv_msg` (response-message, "An invoice attachment is required to complete this PO.") → `complete_inv_end` (end, -1).
    - br=1 (true) → `complete_update` (update `purchase_orders` where id=`{{$context.data.id}}`, status=completed, completed_at=now).
- **Engine split rationale (verified via `flow-nodes test`):** basic has no empty-check + can't count arrays; math.js can't string-compare (`"a"=="b"` → "Cannot convert to number") and errors on `null > 0`. So: string/scalar/null-safe checks (status, total_usd) → basic; array count → math.js. `count()` parses object-array literals fine.
- **Button (BUILT by user — `e60dce0bb2d`):** `RecordTriggerWorkflowActionModel` on the PO detail block `g9xffr68350`, bound to key `qh7b3hc5q1r`. **Linkage rule `us98o7djgw0`** (single `$or`, action=hidden) — hides the button unless completable: hidden when `ctx.record.status $ne "received"` OR `ctx.role $notIncludes "Procurement"` OR `ctx.record.invoice $empty` OR `ctx.record.total_usd $empty` (D34 added the last two; block renders `invoice`/`total_usd` so `ctx.record` carries them). The guard is the hard stop; the button just mirrors it. **Note:** linkage `$empty` won't catch `total_usd == 0` (a value); the server guard's `> 0` does.
- **Verification:** node logic validated via `flow-nodes test`; **end-to-end C1 re-verification PENDING** (user drives the Complete button — custom-action can't be `workflows execute`'d without a user, per `feedback_custom_action_execute_no_user`).

### Guard: PO Immutability (MVP9d) — lock terminal PO header
- **Key:** `xvcsdv07c5j`
- **Active version ID:** `368747670863872` (enabled=true, current=true) — built 2026-06-07, verification pending.
- **Type:** request-interception, global, sync; actions: `update` + `destroy` on `purchase_orders`. Mirrors PR Guard A.
- **Nodes (4):** `po_imm_query` (query purchase_orders, multiple=false, filter id=`{{$context.params.filterByTk}}`, failOnEmpty=false) → `po_imm_cond` (condition, basic, OR `equal {{$jobsMapByNodeKey.po_imm_query.status}}` against `completed`/`closed`, rejectOnFalse=false) → br=1: `po_imm_msg` (response-message, "This PO is finalized and can no longer be edited.") → `po_imm_end` (end, -1).
- **D24 bulk-update limitation applies** (relies on `filterByTk`; bulk update via `filter.$and[0].id.$in` bypasses it) — documented, not fixed (C5). **Payment caveat:** see D33.

### Guard: PO Line Immutability (MVP9d) — lock lines of a terminal PO
- **Key:** `f3dkb37te22`
- **Active version ID:** `368747750555648` (enabled=true, current=true) — built 2026-06-07, verification pending.
- **Type:** request-interception, global, sync; actions: `update` + `destroy` on `po_lines`. Separate from the 9c Receive Guard (`mhfp4d15uee`, which only blocks `received_quantity` on non-receivable POs).
- **Nodes (4):** `line_imm_query` (query po_lines, multiple=false, filter id=`{{$context.params.filterByTk}}`, **appends `[purchase_order]`**, failOnEmpty=false) → `line_imm_cond` (condition, basic, OR `equal {{$jobsMapByNodeKey.line_imm_query.purchase_order.status}}` against `completed`/`closed`, rejectOnFalse=false) → br=1: `line_imm_msg` (response-message, "Lines of a finalized PO can no longer be edited.") → `line_imm_end` (end, -1).
- Workflow-internal updates (9c receiving recompute) bypass request-interception (`feedback_request_interception_scope`), so receiving is unaffected.

### Receive Guard (MVP9c) — block receiving against a non-receivable PO
- **Key:** `mhfp4d15uee`
- **Active version ID:** `368072131870720` (enabled=true, current=true) — built + verified 2026-06-07 (R4 passed).
- **Type:** request-interception, global, sync; actions: `update` on `po_lines`.
- **Node chain (4 nodes):** Query line+parent PO (`567k7v8jzsi`, filter id=`{{$context.params.filterByTk}}`, appends `[purchase_order]`) → Condition (`74kymxgok4k`, basic, **AND** of 5 `notEqual` leaves: `received_quantity` present (`{{$context.params.values.received_quantity}} != null`) AND PO.status ≠ each of sent/confirmed/partially_received/received) → br=1 (true=block): response-message (`9c4j0rzf24t`) → end (`03fvl5yb4vy`, endStatus −1).
- **Design note:** blocks only when the submitted values carry a non-null `received_quantity` AND the PO isn't receivable — so editing a `draft` PO's lines stays allowed *provided `received_quantity` is empty on that form*. Bulk-update caveat (D24) applies. Workflow-internal update nodes bypass this guard (`feedback_request_interception_scope`).

### PO Receiving recompute workflow (MVP9c) — derive line_status + PO header
- **Key:** `ork27v016yo`
- **Active version ID:** `368710576439296` (enabled=true, current=true) — **doc-lag corrected 2026-06-07** (was recorded `368072534523904`; a later user revision is now active). R1–R3 verified on the lineage.
- **Type:** collection event, **sync**, collection `po_lines`; **mode=2 (update), `changed:["received_quantity"]`** (loop guard — the workflow's own line_status/header writes don't re-fire), appends `[purchase_order]`.
- **Node chain (10 nodes):**
  - `nys8gwon5ic` (calculation, **formula.js**) → `line_status` = `IFS(AND(quantity_ordered>0, received_quantity>=quantity_ordered),"received", received_quantity>0,"partially_received", true,"pending")` (reads `{{$context.data.*}}`).
  - `dbaahktlgww` (update po_lines, batch/`individualHooks:false`) → write `line_status={{$jobsMapByNodeKey.nys8gwon5ic}}` to the trigger line (`id={{$context.data.id}}`).
  - `b8bd5brza19` (aggregate count, **A**) → po_lines where `purchase_order.id=<PO>` AND `line_status != received`.
  - `jsj8bqoihag` (aggregate count, **B**) → po_lines where `purchase_order.id=<PO>` AND `received_quantity > 0`.
  - `y7lkvu5cxkx` (condition, **math.js**, rejectOnFalse=false) `{{$jobsMapByNodeKey.b8bd5brza19}} == 0` (all received?):
    - br=1 (true): `913yhkkni8r` Update PO `status=received` → `9wr1evj9pjj` Query Procurement dept (id `363554444476416`, appends `[main_approver]`) → `7421bepct6m` Notification (channel `approval-todo-in-app-message`, receivers `["{{$jobsMapByNodeKey.9wr1evj9pjj.main_approver.id}}"]`=Pat, `ignoreFail:true`, "PO {{po_number}} is fully received and ready to complete.").
    - br=0 (false): `7sncivamuep` (condition, **math.js**) `{{$jobsMapByNodeKey.jsj8bqoihag}} > 0` (any receipts?):
      - br=1 (true): `9tot1o6z03u` Update PO `status=partially_received` (covers R1 + R3 reverse).
      - br=0 (false): no node — header unchanged.
- **Verification status:** line_status formula + both math.js conditions validated via `nb api workflow flow-nodes test`; full R1–R4 passed end-to-end via the user-built receiving UI 2026-06-07.

## UI

- **Purchase Requests page UID:** `cuycec133qb`
- **Table block:** `l1e2iwdwau9` — columns include title, status, quoted_total, quoted_currency, `expenditure_type`, `is_emergency`, `needed_by` (MVP8), `pr_number` (D31 — column wrapper `05rzpmr4pxk`, DisplayTextFieldModel)
- **PR view popup** (DetailsBlockModel `2b367dbd157`): shows all PR fields incl. quote fields, `needs_director_approval`, `supplier`, and the four MVP8 fields. The popup grid `5fb7b74fa30` contained an MVP8 Comments block `52t8wtbzni4` bound to `purchase_requests.comments`; the user removed it post-verification. Re-add via `nb api flow-surfaces add-block` with type `comments` and resource `{binding:"associatedRecords", associationField:"comments"}` targeting the grid.
- **Procurement approval form** (now per-revision, detached from template `k60b738pjy0`): current ProcessFormModel uid varies per workflow revision. MVP8 read-only fields applied.
- **PR create form** (CreateFormModel `e76c40c8c79`, template `n9f8v5vnhhc`): includes `needs_director_approval` checkbox after justification; linkage rule makes justification required when checkbox is checked. MVP8 added `expenditure_type`, `needed_by`, `is_emergency`, `other_attachments` after `needs_director_approval`. **MVP010** added `skip_dept_approval` (CheckboxFieldModel, wrapper `830iodzmcjo`) — **GONE: user rebuilt the create form and dropped both `skip_dept_approval` and `needs_director_approval` from it** (discovered MVP012; the recorded wrapper IDs are stale). **D36/MVP012** added `use_custom_approver` checkbox (wrapper `r9iu06my5ot`) + `custom_approver` picker (wrapper `gfozpat06nw`, inner `RecordPickerFieldModel mu4s7d3w0h2`, selector `TableSelectModel ueeb9ybhmuc`) to grid `5c325101ecc`, with field-linkage rules (fingerprint-based) that show+require `custom_approver` when `use_custom_approver` is on and hide it otherwise. **Picker data scope (same-dept + exclude-self) is NOT set via CLI** — public authoring exposes no data scope on the record picker; set it via the form's "Set data scope" UI setting (manual). Self-approval is independently blocked in the workflow condition.
- **PR detail popup** (`2b367dbd157`): MVP010 added `skip_dept_approval` read-only (DisplayCheckboxFieldModel, wrapper `in24ndj91et`) — **removed in MVP012**. **D36/MVP012** added `use_custom_approver` (wrapper `7jjizc66ex2`) + `custom_approver` (wrapper `9tpfw54yy1e`) read-only. **D31** added `pr_number` read-only (DisplayTextFieldModel, wrapper `24fsysz731w`). **D32** added `board_approval_document` read-only on grid `16975baef39` (DisplayPreviewFieldModel, wrapper `ive719bxqm2`).
- **Generate PO button** (`28jh1q2camo`, MVP9a): `RecordTriggerWorkflowActionModel` on PR table row popup and PR detail popup. Bound to workflow key `2izsx8uv50r`. Two linkage rules:
  - Hide when `record.status != "approved"` OR `record.purchase_order is not empty`.
  - Hide when `ctx.user.roles.title` does not include `"Procurement"` (procurement-only visibility; see [feedback_linkage_rules_user_roles](../../../.claude/projects/-Users-alexander-Documents-Claude-Projects-Havenbeheer-Purchasing/memory/feedback_linkage_rules_user_roles.md) in auto-memory for the pattern).

Approval form surface IDs on the active version: see "Approval surfaces" above.

### Purchase Orders page (MVP9a/9b)
- **Page UID:** `liwmklclbnc`
- **Table block:** `vldbcvf41r6`
- **PO detail popup (DetailsBlockModel):** `g9xffr68350`; row-popup template `wp2s32qgfeg`.
- **Send PO button** (`slybgc23q1i`, MVP9b): `RecordTriggerWorkflowActionModel`, bound to workflow key `send_po` (set via `nb api resource update --resource flowModels`). Linkage: hide when `record.status != "draft"`; procurement-only (`ctx.user.roles.title` not-includes `"Procurement"`).
- **Print button** (`c579329db0d`, MVP9e): `TemplatePrintRecordActionModel` on PO detail block `g9xffr68350`, beside Send. Bound to template `kkooshlz8rf` (`props.templateName`), `convertedToPDF:true`. Renders the branded PO PDF via Carbone+LibreOffice (server-side). No linkage rules (visible to all PO viewers). See the `printingTemplates` collection + MVP9e notes below.
- **Close PO button** (`lylrxwl1b3g`, MVP9b): `PopupCollectionActionModel` — opens a popup with an EditForm bound to the current record. Form fields: `close_reason` (`qou6ge8axe5`, required) + `close_comment` (`h5872h3mc8r`, required). Submit action `5ove3dxktz9` triggers workflow key `close_po_draft`. Same draft + procurement-only linkage as Send. (Close-from-non-draft broadens this in 9d.)

### Stale workflow keys:
- `p4n6dffjcgq` / version `364960795000832` — does not exist
- `p1tnx6nb5r9` / version `364995697901568` — disabled rebuild from between sessions
- `idezsq1k1ts` / `363982109736960` — original v3-plan MVP1 key, superseded
- `1r4vyfbnie8` — hardcoded on the Generate-PO button before workflow build; no workflow with this key ever existed.

### Stale Generate-PO (`2izsx8uv50r`) versions (all disabled before `367255610327040`):
- `366569458696192` — initial build with JSON-filter embedded guard.
- `366595041853440` — round-2 revision that wrongly removed the inline guard.
- `366602797121536` — interim revision.
- `366608098721792` — round-3 revision: restored guard but missed the end-process node on the false branch.
- `366623370182656` — interim user revision.
- `366623590383616` — was recorded as active through the $300-floor session; superseded by user revisions.
- `366626266349568`, `366626572533760` — later user revisions; `366626572533760` was the live active version (executed=9) immediately before the D31 revision.
- All superseded 2026-05-30 by `367255610327040` (current, D31).

### Stale Send-PO (`send_po`) versions (all disabled before `367086330314752`):
- `366981771362304` — was recorded as active through MVP9c; superseded by a later user revision `367086330314752` (current). Earlier disabled versions below.
- `366776493735936`, `366882024521728`, `366883251355648` — early build iterations.
- `366883769352192` — had the zone-2 bug (basic-engine `gt` condition that never fired).
- `366980364173312` — a revision where the agent patched the zone-2 condition with `.result` (wrong theory); superseded by the user's math.js fix in `366981771362304`.
- `366980536139776` (**key `s6m4i5hrmzs`**, title "Send PO copy") — a stray *duplicate* (new key, not in the `send_po` lineage) created by the CLI `workflow workflows revision` command, which duplicates rather than versions. Disabled, unreferenced; left in place (deletion needs explicit user OK).

### Stale Complete-PO (`qh7b3hc5q1r`) versions (disabled before `368971625791488`):
- `368746204954624` — original MVP9d build (status==received only, no invoice gate). Executed 3× (user C1 runs). Disabled 2026-06-09 by the D34 invoice-gate revision `368971625791488` (current).

### Disabled po_lines collection workflows (cancelled per D27):
- `jsgbxph9444` ("PO Total: Lines Added/Updated", id `366562246590464`) — was a sync collection trigger on po_lines create/update that aggregated `line_total`. Disabled 2026-05-27 because the field no longer exists; the sync failure was silently rolling back po_line creates from the Generate-PO workflow. Keep disabled.
- `s4syz7vom4n` ("PO Total: Line Deleted", id `366562257076224`) — sibling delete trigger for the same total-maintenance scheme. Also disabled.

## Notes for the next session

- **MVP9d — DONE + VERIFIED 2026-06-09.** Complete workflow (`qh7b3hc5q1r`, D34 active ver `368971625791488`), broadened Close (`f8gpu17s6hq`), Close Guard (`b6brl8r9c58`), and the two immutability guards (`xvcsdv07c5j` PO header, `f3dkb37te22` po_lines) are live + enabled. **Complete button** `e60dce0bb2d` on PO detail block `g9xffr68350`. **End-to-end verification passed 2026-06-09** — all 8 cases green: C1 (received+invoice+USD→completed), C2 (Complete button hidden on non-received), D34a (received, no invoice→blocked/hidden), D34b (received, invoice, total_usd=0→server guard rejects), D35 (Close Guard blocks Close on `received`, close_reason never persists), C3 (Close on `sent`→closed), C4 (header edit on completed PO blocked), C5 (line edit on completed PO blocked). Verified by Pat-driven UI clicks against **API-staged throwaway fixtures** PR-26-0008..0011 / PO-26-T1..T4 (see cleanup note below). MVP9d milestone committed.
- **Test-fixture cleanup PENDING (low priority):** verification used throwaway records — PRs `PR-26-0008/0009/0010/0011` (ids 368984082874368, …874369, …874370, 368984084971520) and POs `PO-26-T1/T2/T3/T4` (ids 368984504401923, 368984531664899, 368984533762051, 368984533762055). **They can't be deleted normally** — the very guards we verified block it: PR Guard A blocks destroy on `approved` PRs; PO immutability blocks destroy on T1(closed)/T4(completed). T2/T3 (received) are deletable. To purge fully, temporarily disable Guard A + PO immutability, delete, re-enable. Left in place for now (harmless test noise).
- **MVP9e — DONE + VERIFIED 2026-06-09.** PO template printing: Carbone template record `printingTemplates:kkooshlz8rf` ("Purchase Order") → `storage/print-templates/po-template-mvp9e.docx`, Havenbeheer-branded (logo + contact letterhead, green theme). Print button **`c579329db0d`** on PO detail block `g9xffr68350` bound to it (`convertedToPDF:true`). Repo source: `templates/build_po_template.py` + `purchase-order-template.docx` + `main-logo.png`. User confirmed the live PDF (PO-26-0006) looks great; P2 (internal_notes never prints) holds. Status / expected_delivery / ref-PR were dropped from the final design per user. Gotchas saved to auto-memory `feedback_template_print_{authoring,select_label,carbone_date_format}`. The PO detail block's Close button `lylrxwl1b3g` is gone (user removed it earlier on purpose).
- **PO surface drift (FYI):** the user rebuilt the PO detail block — the doc's Close button `lylrxwl1b3g` is gone (removed on purpose). (MVP9e Print button is now configured — see above.)
- **Doc-lag corrected this session:** Send-PO active `367086330314752`, PR-Approval active `368641179582464`, Receiving-recompute active `368710576439296` (see sections + Stale IDs). The PR-Approval node/surface tables still describe `367885604880384` and were not re-inspected — refresh them next time that workflow is touched. Stray disabled PR-Approval ver `368062113775616` not re-confirmed.
- **MVP7 was descoped.** Only `suppliers` was built; `supplier_issues` and `supplier_evaluations` are postponed (D26). Don't assume they exist.
- **Supplier UI:** if a suppliers list/detail page was built during MVP7, its page UID isn't recorded here yet — capture it the next time it's touched.
- **MVP8 ACL note:** Field-level edit gating for procurement/director on PR content stays enforced via form-pattern (`readPretty`) only, not strict ACL. Procurement+director roles still technically have those fields in their `update` whitelist via strategy-based ACL (`usingActionsConfig=false`). Tightening to independent permissions is a future hardening MVP. The four MVP8 fields inherit this same posture.
- **Role strategies (data-source global `actions`):** admin `create/view/update/destroy/export/importXlsx/trigger`; director `view/update/create`; member `view/update/create`; **procurement `view/trigger/update` (no global create)**; finance/root `null`. **D32 ACL override:** procurement has an *independent* resource permission on `attachments` = `view/create/update` (scope all, `usingActionsConfig=true`, resource config id `367892747780096`) so approvers can upload the board document. Do NOT add global `create` to procurement (would let it create PRs, violating D25).
